matlabdoc
=========

Automatically generate beautiful matlab code documentation using python. This
project was inspired by m2html.
[m2html](http://www.artefact.tk/software/matlab/m2html/) which works great but

1. it isn't python
2. it isn't as beautiful as sphinx documentation
3. I'd rather do stuff in python than in MATLAB

m2html uses its own template toolbox ... which is also great ... but not jinja2.

Is this for you?
----------------
This is for you if any of these apply to you

1. You, like me, like python/scipy/numpy but have to use MATLAB in a project
2. You want pretty documentation out of the box
3. You just want to try something different

No matter what
--------------

**DOCUMENT your code!** It doesn't really matter if you do it with m2html,
matlab report generation, or matlabdoc as long as it is there and available.
